			<p class="description">The coat can be either smooth or rough; the smooth coat being close and flat while the rough is dense, flat, and more profuse around the neck and legs. The colour is typically a red shade with white, or a mahogany brindle with white. Black shading is usually found on the face and ears. The tail is long and heavy, hanging low. Eyes are usually brown, but sometimes can be icy blue, and should have naturally tight lids, with haws only slightly visible.</p>
